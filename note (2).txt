# === List of Graph Types and Their Ideal Use Cases ===

# 1. Histogram
# Use when: 
# - You want to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable.
# - You need to understand how data is spread and identify skewness, modality, or outliers.
# Example: 
# - Distribution of exam scores, income distribution, or age distribution.

# 2. Boxplot
# Use when:
# - You need to visualize the spread, central tendency, and outliers of a numerical variable.
# - Ideal for comparing multiple groups or variables.
# Example:
# - Comparing salaries across different job roles or the range of BGL values in different age groups.

# 3. Countplot
# Use when:
# - You want to show the frequency distribution of a categorical variable.
# - Ideal for comparing the size of categories.
# Example:
# - Count of people in each age group, or frequency of different juice types consumed.

# 4. Scatterplot
# Use when:
# - You need to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.
# - Good for detecting correlations, trends, and clustering.
# Example:
# - Relationship between height and weight, or age vs BGL levels.

# 5. Correlation Heatmap
# Use when:
# - You want to understand correlations between multiple numerical variables.
# - Great for detecting linear relationships between pairs of variables.
# Example:
# - Correlation between age, sugar consumption, exercise, and BGL.

# 6. Pairplot
# Use when:
# - You want to visualize pairwise relationships between multiple variables.
# - Good for examining distributions and relationships for multi-variable analysis.
# Example:
# - Visualizing how different factors like age, exercise, and juice consumption interact in relation to BGL.

# 7. Violin Plot
# Use when:
# - You need to show the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories.
# - It combines features of boxplots and density plots, making it useful for comparing distributions.
# Example:
# - Distribution of BGL across different levels of exercise routine.

# 8. Line Plot
# Use when:
# - You want to show trends over time or a continuous variable.
# - Ideal for visualizing time series data.
# Example:
# - Trends of BGL levels over different age groups or over time.

# 9. Bar Plot
# Use when:
# - You want to compare the sizes of different categories (categorical data).
# - Ideal for categorical comparisons.
# Example:
# - Number of admissions per department, or frequency of different categories like juice types.

# 10. Stacked Bar Plot
# Use when:
# - You want to compare categories within categories.
# - Ideal for showing proportions or segmented data.
# Example:
# - Admissions by gender and department.

# 11. Heatmap
# Use when:
# - You want to visualize complex data in a matrix form.
# - Ideal for showing relationships or patterns in two-dimensional data.
# Example:
# - Displaying user interaction data or the correlation matrix of multiple variables.

# 12. Pie Chart
# Use when:
# - You want to show proportions of a whole.
# - Best for fewer categories, typically 3-6 categories.
# Example:
# - Market share, or distribution of juice types consumed in a survey.

# 13. Funnel Plot
# Use when:
# - You want to show the progression of a variable through stages.
# - Typically used in marketing, sales, or other sequential data.
# Example:
# - Conversion rates in a marketing campaign.

# 14. Radar Chart (Spider Plot)
# Use when:
# - You need to visualize multivariate data on a circular graph.
# - Ideal for comparing multiple variables at once, especially with categorical data.
# Example:
# - Comparing multiple characteristics (e.g., BGL, age, sugar intake, exercise) for different juice types.

# 15. Treemap
# Use when:
# - You want to visualize hierarchical data and proportions within subcategories.
# - Ideal for large data sets with categories and subcategories.
# Example:
# - Visualizing market share by company and region.

# 16. Regression Line (with Scatterplot)
# Use when:
# - You need to model and visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.
# - Ideal for understanding linear relationships.
# Example:
# - Age vs BGL, or sugar intake vs BGL.

# 17. Residual Plot
# Use when:
# - You want to visualize the residuals (errors) from a regression model.
# - Helps to check model assumptions (e.g., homoscedasticity).
# Example:
# - Checking residuals of a linear regression model for predicting BGL from age.

# 18. ANOVA Plot (Analysis of Variance)
# Use when:
# - You want to visualize the results of an ANOVA test comparing multiple groups.
# - Helps understand differences between group means.
# Example:
# - Comparing BGL means across different juice types or exercise levels.

# 19. Mosaic Plot
# Use when:
# - You need to visualize the relationship between two or more categorical variables.
# - Good for showing proportions and interactions between categories.
# Example:
# - Proportion of age groups across different genders or juice types.

# 20. Swarm Plot
# Use when:
# - You want to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable with jittered points.
# - Ideal for understanding the spread and clustering of categorical data.
# Example:
# - Distribution of BGL for different exercise levels.

# === Tips for Data Visualization ===
# - For small datasets, scatterplots and bar charts are good choices.
# - For large datasets, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps help summarize the data.
# - Use line plots for continuous time series data or trends.
# - Heatmaps and pairplots are excellent for exploring correlations.


Numerical vs Categorical: Use scatterplots for continuous variables, and bar plots for categorical comparisons.
Time Series: Line plots are the best way to display trends over time.
Relationships: Correlation heatmaps, scatterplots, and pairplots are excellent for detecting relationships.
Distribution: Histograms, boxplots, and violin plots help visualize the spread of data.
Comparing Groups: Use boxplots, bar plots, and ANOVA for comparing groups.
High-dimensional data: Visualize with pairplots, heatmaps, or radar charts.
